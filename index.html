                in an increase in productivity inside these departments and for the rest of the company. A customer oriented
                person that enjoys turning complex problems into efficient, well-structured code, and a responsive, intuitive
                interface design.

                that allow her to add new skills and technologies to her toolbelt. She enrolled in UNCC Coding Bootcamp where
                she is exploring the powerful skill set of web development, along with the opportunity of getting deeply
                involved with the tech community in Charlotte. A problem solver that will use her knowledge and passion to
                change people's lives. </p>
